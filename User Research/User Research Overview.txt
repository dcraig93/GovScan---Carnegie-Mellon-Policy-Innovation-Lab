The user research for GovScan followed HCD (Human Centered Design) principles and best practices and methods for qualitative user research. We conducted some light desktop research to understand the problem space of use cases of PDF program reports within the government. We conducted 12 interviews over the span of 2 weeks with professionals from a variety of job categories within the US State and Federal Governments, and NGOs as well as non-profit advocacy groups. As a culmination of our primary and secondary research (desktop and interviews), we came up with a user research synthesis report consisting of key findings, user personas, key insights, and most importantly - product opportunity gaps and guiding design principles. It is noteworthy to mention that before we started our user research process, we conducted some light problem area scoping to optimize our design sprints and break down the problem into a digestible focus area. We primarily focused on understanding CCDF program reports and built our initial prototype catering to those.
