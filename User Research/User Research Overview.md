# User Research Overview

## Initial Prompt Received from USDS
"Can we take state plans for programs that are federally funded and state run (for example: Medicaid and child care subsidies) and make them digestible, easily searchable and actually useful to understand how 50 different states are implementing programs?

For example, states have to submit state plans to HHS (the Administration for Children and Families) to explain how they plan to implement their child care subsidy programs under ACF's regulations. These end up being PDFs of 300-400 pages that most likely contain a lot of interesting and useful information about how states are tackling different child care challenges - yet these resources are incredibly difficult to use as a policymaker because you can't easily compare across states or parse the information within. 

How might we use AI / ML tools to quickly parse these documents and create an easy-to-reference matrix that provides a snapshot of what's happening in these programs across the country?

Example from ACF based on the child care use case: https://www.acf.hhs.gov/occ/form/approved-ccdf-plans-fy-2022-2024Links to an external site. 

There is a wealth of information trapped inside these PDFs.  ACF also has a digital services team that might be willing to provide additional insight and thoughts on these are related challenges. 
Seed questions
How might we improve the usability of PDF reports for federally funded / state run programs?
How might we provide better transparency into the effectiveness of these programs?
How might we leverage technologies to build better products for decision-makers?
How might we create tools that could be easily repurposed for other, similar use cases?"


## High Level Process
The user research for GovScan followed HCD (Human Centered Design) principles and best practices and methods for qualitative user research. We conducted some light desktop research to understand the problem space of use cases of PDF program reports within the government. We conducted 12 interviews over the span of 2 weeks with professionals from a variety of job categories within the US State and Federal Governments, and NGOs as well as non-profit advocacy groups. As a culmination of our primary and secondary research (desktop and interviews), we came up with a user research synthesis report consisting of key findings, user personas, key insights, and most importantly - product opportunity gaps and guiding design principles. It is noteworthy to mention that before we started our user research process, we conducted some light problem area scoping to optimize our design sprints and break down the problem into a digestible focus area. We primarily focused on understanding CCDF program reports and built our initial prototype catering to those.
