# Welcome to GovScan
## Overview
GovScan is a vectorbase powered large language model (LLM) that simultaneously scans multiple large PDF documents and leverages generative artificial intellegence (AI) to return specific data requests. Unlike Chat GPT, GovScan maintains source disaggregation so that each return can be linked directly to the orignial document text in which it was found. This provides users with the abilty to search and compare large PDF documents with the click of only one button, almost like using the age-old CTRL+F shortcut, but for an entire document library at once using natural language prompts like, "Hey GovScan, how does Pennsylvania determine Childcare Development Funding (CCDF) eligibility compared to Ohio?". GovScan has the potential to save users hours of time and millions of dollars in document research, all the while increasing the usability of large PDF documents.

## Background
With the advent of the Portable Document Format (PDF) in 1993became the golden standard for document sharing in 1993 and PDF utilization has grown State plans are comprehensive documents that state governments submit to federal agencies to outline how they intend to administer various federal programs or initiatives within their jurisdictions. For example, states must submit state plans to HHS (the Administration for Children and Families) to explain how they plan to implement their childcare subsidy programs under ACF's regulations. 

They help policymakers evaluate the stateâ€™s alignment with federal goals, promote accountability and transparency, and supply data for informed decision-making. Citizens could also use state plans for accessing program information, understanding resource allocation, and evaluating program outcomes thus facilitating engagement and transparency in government services and policies.
