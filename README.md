# Welcome to GovScan
## Overview
GovScan is a vectorbase powered large language model (LLM) that simultaneously scans multiple large PDF documents and leverages generative artificial intellegence (AI) to return specific data requests. Unlike Chat GPT, GovScan maintains source disaggregation so that each return can be linked directly to the orignial document text in which it was found. This provides users with the abilty to search and compare large PDF documents with the click of only one button, almost like using the age-old CTRL+F shortcut, but for an entire document library at once using natural language prompts like, "Hey GovScan, how does Pennsylvania determine Childcare Development Funding (CCDF) eligibility compared to Ohio?". GovScan has the potential to save users hours of time and millions of dollars in document research, all the while increasing the usability of large PDF documents.

## Background
With the advent of the Portable Document Format (PDF) in 1993 and then Adobe's decision to release the proprietary format as an open standard in 2008, the PDF has become widely adopted as the preferrecd method for securing digital documents. Now private businesses and public agencies alike face the burden of managing extensive libraries of PDFs in a way that allows for easy retrieval when information is needed. The problem is, a human seeking information from a PDF can only one review one document at a time. This limitation has resulted in costly hours spent reviewing documents one-by-one to find the desired information. Consider a federal policy analyst working for the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, the Administration for Children and Families who is repsonsible for reviewing state Child Care Development Fund (CCDF) plans to ensure compliance with federal regulations.
